Sayonara, my beautiful daughter. Mono

You are like the

 flower
 that

like this spring,
 so lovely and full of 
life
 and 
color
. You are here in my 
life for only a short time, enchanting me with your innocent beauty 
and kind soul, and a brief moment later you are gone again, out of my 
life. 
Thus, I
 shall name you Sakura. I am sad, my darling da

to leave you behind. I am sad to never see you grow up, feel your love, 

or

 But I am not a worthy mother

 * * * * * 
Sakura, with no last name,
 was found in spring on the 
doorstep of Qu
een Mary Orphanage
 in a small town called
 South 
Hampton 
in St. Joseph Island. Her
 mother mysteriously 
disappeared
 after leaving the baby girl in a bas
ket along with a note 
that said
 My 
d
name is Sakura
 and a beautiful necklace 
with a pink diamond 
pendant in the shape of a cherry blossom. 
 Sakura was a shy, quiet girl. Her childhood lacked the love and 
affection that one receives from one
 parents. From very early on, 
she knew she 

 have a mother or a father and longed to have 
2     Alexia Praks
  them. She did 
not interact much with the other children in the 
orphanage, knowing she looked different, having half-
Caucasian 
and ha
lf-Asian blood, and therefore 
she 
was constantly picked on.  
Mrs. Byrd, the headmistress of the orphanage, did

Sakura very much,
 and neither did 
her pretty little daughter,
 Tara 
Byrd, who was 

s age and her worst nightmare. It wa
s apparent from very early on that Tara was destined to be S

enemy. The little blond-
haired,
 blue-
eyed girl enjoyed tormenting 
Sakura and making fun of her, isolating the girl from the rest and 
setting her as a target for her amusement.  
Tara knew she was pretty and everyone adored her. She 
had her 
mother and most of the staff at the orphanage wrapped around her 

little finger. Many 
times she would tell her mother, and everyone 
else for that matter, lies about Sakura.
 T
hat Sakura worship
ed heathen gods other than their Jesus Christ, spoke to the devil, stole 
food from the kitchen, bullied her or the younger children, and 
many more.  
Mrs. Byrd, always believing her beloved daughter, would 
punish Sakura many times, slapping the little girl on the cheeks
, spanking her backside, taking away her toys and books, denying 
her meals, and making her kneel on the concrete floor in the 

church from midday until midnight without any food or water,
 all 
in order to teach her a lesson. Hence Sakura lived in the orphanage 
being bullied, hated, and ignored.  
Eventually, she grew 
accustomed to being alone and learn
ed to 
endure the harassment. When she was told to pray to God for 
forgiveness for being a naughty girl, she prayed instead 

adopted by a nice family who loved her and to leave this 
horrendous place where no one liked 

about it actually happening, about her going far away and living 

with her very own fa
mil
 smile,
 and 
thank 
the Lord for making her dream come true before it actually 
happened.  
Such was the power of positive thinking and law of attraction, 

 come true one day.  
A Secret Kiss     3 
 The family she wanted to belong to appeared after she turned 
seven years old. It was during the summer, and the children of 
Queen Mary Orphanage were invited to have a picnic with the 

Princetons, the wealthiest family on St. Joseph Island and sponsors 

of the orphanage.  
Sakura knew the moment she stepped out of the bus and onto 
the neatly paved pathway and exotically beautiful garden that she 
wanted to be here. When she stared up at the enormous mansion 
like those castles in fairytale books, she sucked in her brea
th with 
pleasure. Her head spun in delight as she gazed 
up at the building 
that stretched high above her.  

o big!

murmured with delight. 
And Sakura agreed 
with them.  
The man of the house came out to greet them. He was very 
handsome with silvery-gray eyes and golden-
blond hair, very much 
like Tara

 a nice smile on his 
face as he greeted every one of them, and Sakura felt her heart 

quicken with happiness as his eyes met hers. There was kindness 

within those eyes that Sakura had never received from anyone 

before.  
The man ushered the children to the large garden with 
a gentle, 
rolling lawn and magnolia trees,
 where delicious food and sweet 
drinks waited for them to enjoy. That was when the whole family 
came out, and Sakura instantly fell in love with them and knew 
she wanted to be with them.  
They were a big family, just like she
d always wanted, and she 
did her best learning their names when they were introducing 

themselves to everyone.  
The nice 

 James Princeton, and the pretty 

 was Brenda Princeton. The oldest son was Nicolas, who 
was twelve years old and had golden-
blond hair and silvery-
gray 
eyes like his father, complete with glasses. He looked kind and at 
the same time serious, just like his father. Then there were the ten-
year-
olds, nonidentical triplets:
 Tristan with golden-
brown hair 
and teal-
blue eyes,
 Logan with copper-
brown hair and silvery-
gray 
eyes, and Sebastian with pale-
blond hair and azure-blue eyes.  
4     Alexia Praks
  The boy with chestnut-
brown hair and cobalt-blue eyes was 
eight-
year-
old Hayden. He had a mischievous look about him as 
he introduced himself. Next to Hayden were the nonidentical 
twins,
 Alaina and Darcy, at six years old. Alaina, the older sister by 
a mere three minutes, had honey-blond hair and baby blue eyes, 

and Darcy, the younger brother, had raven-
black hair and mauve-
gray eyes. And then there was the baby of the house,
 Conrad, at 
four years old, with golden-
brown hair and silvery-
gray eyes, 
hiding his fa

 
children because they 
fascinated her. She felt a pang of longing as she watched them play 

with the other children, especially with pretty Tara.  
It was

afternoon that Sakura became aware of one 
of the boys, Sebastian, watching her.  


 Sakura shook her head as she gazed at him, marveling at his 
blond hair that glittered like white gold under the sun a
nd his 
azure-
blue eyes, the same color as the beautiful summer sky that 
shone and stretched endlessly beyond the horizon.  
She knew very well what he meant, for the majority of the 
population living on St. Joseph Island was white,
 and she,
 a half-
bred little girl who
d been c
ast away by her own parents, was a rare 
specimen indeed.

 Sakura gasped

her heart to flutter with joy.

at the soft, pale skin.

 And so Sakura had a nickname that she herself did not have 
a vote in, and soon the children returned to their play and forgot all 
about her.  
Every night after that day, Sakura prayed the Princetons would 
adopt her into their family. Then one day her dream came 
true in 
the 
most 
bizarre way.  
The orphanage was on fire and the whole building burned 
down, killing Mrs.
 Byrd, though all of the children and staff 
escaped. After some hard and fast investigation by the police, it 
was found that Mrs.
 Byrd had been smoking in the kitchen while 
the gas was still on,
 thus leading to an explosion.  
However, a rumor was spread that Sakura was actually 
responsible for starting the fire by leaving the oven gas turned on. 

Though she had done no such thing, she could not rebuke the 

claim that Tara and her friends made as witness
es to the whole 
8     Alexia Praks
  ordeal. Soon Sakura found herself hated by everyone who knew 
her,
 and 
she 
lost all hope of an adoption.  
One week after the incident, James Princeton walked in, 

ave done such a 
terrible thing, 
and since she had 
nowhere to go and no one would 
take her, he and his wife would adopt her.  
Sakura was so relieved and happy over 

for the first 
time in her seven years, she cried 
in front of everyone. 
James wiped away her
 tears, told her everything would be all right, 
lifted her into his arms, and took 
her home to his family.

headed 
back toward the road as she hummed to herself.  
Woof! Woof! Woof! 
Sakura felt something soft grazing against her legs. She glanced 
down and saw a cute dog with fluffy white fur and large black eyes 
watching her, begging for her attention. The West Highland white

barked her a happy greeting.

all, she had her own life and her own plans for the future to worry 

about and therefore had 
no time for their bull. 
As she breathed in th
e fresh spring air and strolled along the 
woodland, a thought suddenly struck her. She nibbled her lower 

lip, her 
eyes gazing off into the far distance to the sea beyond.  
Would they still remember her, 
though?  
She scoffed at the thought immediately. Of course not! If they 
remember
ed anything about her at all, it was probably the pranks 
they had played on her and the many scoldings they had received 

from Daddy James and Mom Brenda because of her. Not that 

shed ever been the one who told on them. It had always been

Not very long after, Sakura too had gone off to St. Helensburgh 
Boarding School for Girls where she met her friends Mary Collins, 
who also turned out to be the boys
 
side, and Katherine Hodge, a girl from a good family who also 

lived on St. Joseph Island. She, Mary, and Katherine had many 
lovely times together, helping each other with schoolwork and 
enjoying each other
s company,
 both in and out of school. 
Back then, during the 
holidays, Sakura would stay with the 
Collins
es at their farm in California, enjoying her times there with 

other, Richard
. Then every so 
often Daddy James and Mom Brenda would come and stay with 

them for a couple of days along with Dale and Molly, her adopted 

grandparents from Daddy 

s side of the family. During those 
times, Sakura had never felt more warm, happy,
 and complete to 
have such a wonderful circle of family and friends. Hence she never 

really saw the boys
nor Alaina and Tara for that matter
ever 
since she left thirteen years ago. By the time she completed her 

science degree at UCLA and had returned to St. Joseph Island to 

work in the local hospital, they all had left home completely to live 

wherever their hearts had taken them. Of course,
 she had no idea 
where they were living now, and to be frankly honest, neither did 
she care.
 
she asked Toby, who 
was 
busy sticking his tongue out and sniffing the air with interest.

  With that thought in mind, she smiled up at the sky and closed 
her eyes, savoring 
this very moment, cherishing it in her memory, 
and praying very hard that s

given her life.

Then Hayden arrived on his motorbike

he was now

him out after she

Tristan insisted they had no choice but to comfort Darcy by 
taking him out drinking until early dawn, which in due course led 

to a house full of men with hangovers the next morning 

accompanied by lots of moaning, groaning, and of course very 

colorful cursing from Darcy,
 who naturally wanted to also murder 
Tristan for his distasteful tricks. They all knew

By that evening,
 they were completely sober except for Darcy,

The next day,

 She was sure if she dated him every woman would envy her. Of

 she was sure guys secretly envied him as well. Not to

six years 
of age had accomplished so much. With his real estate business and 
A Secret Kiss

 now he was planning to get 
another business up and running.  
Deep down she was very glad all the brothers were still single

Tara grinned and lay back, feeling the warm sun on her skin. 
She had 
this whole spring 
to work on it. Sooner or later Sebastian 
Princeton
or Darcy Princeton,
 for that matter
would be hers. 

 Darcy said from the 
high-

only town on St. Joseph Island that suddenly appeared in the 

distance.  
It was a picturesque island with Mount St. Joseph standing 
grandly in the middle,
 the lush, green woods surrounding it and 
the historic, Victorian town securely nestl
ed against its bosom to 
the west side.  
This was their hometown, had 

since 1750 when the first generation had arrived from England 

and 
made this island theirs. 
Darcy felt his heart do a somersault,
 and an odd pain spread 
out across his chest. It wasn
t physical pain, but a type of emotional 
pain he was sure he
d had before that was now buried deep within 
his heart, forgotten. Now it was there again,
 and he didn

have a 
clue why. He fisted his hands, feeling frustration building up 

within him as he watched the island getting bigger and bigger as 

the yacht sailed closer and closer.  
Sebastian strode to the side of the deck and gazed out at the 
island in the distance. Suddenly, he felt an odd thump in his chest, 
22     Alexia Praks
  as if there were something on the island that made him pause, and 
he wondered 
why. 
Not long after, 
the luxury 
yacht, the 
Lady Elizabeth
, came 
into the harbor of St. Joseph Island, and soon they were 
ready to drive 
home to Princeton Mansion, which was located on the other side 

of the island, about 
twenty-
five minutes
 drive from town. 
The brothers decided to split up into the two out of the three 
Mercedes-
Benz 

d brought along in the yacht. Tara and Alaina, 
on the other hand, decided 

shopping before driving home. 
 Once they were out of the busy, tourist-
infested town, they 
pretty much had the road to themselves, and Tristan being Tristan 

went over the speed limit and,
 just to annoy Sebastian, dangerously 
overtook his brother.

A split second later,

a narrow road,
 which was covered by thick woods on both sid

 it, Sebastian quickly stepped on the brake, his 
heart pounding with dread as the car headed straight toward the 

person who suddenly materialized as if out of the blue onto the 
middle of the road.

 The voice! Oh gosh! The voice!
 Sakura 
had the feeling she

that voice before. Only now it was deeper and manlier and caused 
her stomach to flip and her heart to race.  
She lifted her head and came face-
to-face with a handsome 
young man with raven-
black hair and mauve-
gray eyes. Sakura 
held her breath as she stared at Darcy, drowning herself in the 

depth of the unique color that once had looked at her with 

affection. 
Darcy felt his body 
go rigid, his heart skipped a couple of beats, 
and he just stopped breathing altogether for a couple 
of seconds 
the moment he saw the dark-
haired, dark-
eyed beauty that was 
their victim. To say she was 
beautiful was 
an understatement. She 
literally took his breath away, and indeed,
 he found it hard to find 
his breath again.
 Suddenly he felt the world swimming around him 
as he continued to gaze at her. Something deep within him stirred
, inching its way from within the locked chains that kept it 

imprisoned, preventing it from ever escaping.  
Then it happened. A soft, gentle voice echo

. Darce

!  That voice! Whose voice is that?
 Why did it call to 
me? Why was it 
referring to me as

  Darcy didn
t have any answers to these burning questions 
swirling within his head as he began 
to feel himself tense. 
Under his intense gaze, Sakura felt the heat rising steadily 
within her. Involuntarily, she trembled and quickly glanced

lost in the

 Sebastian was so taken aback by her burst of outrage that he 
did

 do. The other brothers, who had gathered

to pick her up like that. But not this one. This one demand

 What was even more odd was the fact

leave her sitting there. Then he sensed his brothers gathering 

around him, and when their victim finally raised her face to them, 

he heard Tristan suck

 Like moths attracted to a flame, the rest of the brothers saw the 
most enticing image 
theyd ever seen. This was, of course, instantly 
followed by sharp inhalations. Sebastian wanted to hide the poor

was 
too pretty for her own good
from his 
brothers

 
 not only two of the 
Princeton brothers but all seven of them to deal with. Sebastian 

was still staring at her as if God himself had just descended from 

heaven. Nicolas looked so shocked to see a woman and a dog in

watching a really interesting movie. 
And Darcy? 
Her heart jolt

her breasts and hinting at just how beautiful they could be if she 

were naked.  
Sebastian had had enough. H

his brothers enjoying the poor girl in such a dire situation. He bent 

down to help her, his hand touching her arm once again. She 

gasped and pushed him away.  
The brothers watch
ed in shocked surprise because no female 
had ever pushed Sebastian away. Girls flocked to him
as they did 
to all his brothers. It was the Princeton charm, not to mention the 

mere fact that they were very 
good-looking. Women found them 
hot and would do anything to date them;
 even just getting close to 
them was a dream come true. But it was odd indeed that this young

Not when they had been 
younger, after they played tricks on her,
 and not even now. The thought brought forw
ard a rush of anger, 
and she saw 
red.  
She stared at them, one by one, no longer afraid of them as 
shed been when she was 
young.  
First, there was Sebastian with the typical Princeton looks that 
dated back for generations and had caused many hearts to flutter 
recklessly and perhaps even swoon with longing. He was also way 
too tall, broad 
at the shoulders, and handsome for her liking. No
t to mention the fact that he was wearing one of those studs in his 
left ear,
 the stone the same color as his eyes. It made him look
 like 
a rogue and way 

 Then there was Nicolas,
 so much like his father, James, who 
looked as though he could take on the world and would still come 
out on top with his leader-

Next was Tristan with his ridiculously handsome smile,
 the 
Prince of F

he had 
bedded already and how many hearts 
he had 
broken along 
the way.  
The same went for Logan with hi

He looked like a bloody pira

and 
Sakura was

and imprisoned in his bed.  
Then there was the handsome, mysterious Darcy. Again, her 
heart decided to do an unwelcome somersault,
 which caused her 
to grit her teeth in annoyance
. 
Darce! My Darce!
 The sound kept echoing within her head. 
Sakura suppressed the urge to scream out just so the little voice 

would stop bothering her.  
Yes, the Prince of Darkness was staring at her now without 
recognition, as if he found 

help staring back at him. God, his hair was long and very black, 

even blacker than she remembered. And those unique eyes of his

Finally, trays of savories arrived. The two maids nervously put

coffee.

 Yes, he loved them, for they brought forward a sense of

reminded him of something lovely, something wonderful, 

something warm, yet something painful as well. For the life of him, 

however, he could not think of what, when, why,

a large tray and tossed on some chocolate biscuits, mini-

sandwiches, muffins, and an apple and a bunch of red grapes. After 
that, she grabbed a bottle of apple juice and a glass and then rushed 
off to the back stairs where she was sure no one would see her. 

Toby followed closely behind.

putting them up for sale on her website. Now and again, she

and quickly locked it. An instant later,
 the doorknob wriggled as 
if someone were trying to open it.

 A few moments later, the hallway was quiet again, and Sakura 
sighed with relief.  


 About half an hour later,
 she heard them leaving their rooms

able to fully relax.

cherry blossom petals raining down on him from a massive tree of pink 

cloud. Some landed on his face. They were feathery soft and cool on his 
skin. He could smell the light, beautiful scent, and it reminded him of 
spring. Oddly enough, he felt at peace. He felt happy. And there was 

something else, too. Yes, he felt loved. So much love.

 He gazed long and hard at her, trying to 
make out her features, but it was to no avail. She was faceless to him. 
She turned to look at him. Though he couldn

was beautiful. He could also sense she was smiling at him. It was as

 he thought with dread. 
Where did she go? He felt his heart thumping loud and hard 
within his chest.  
He sat up, frowning, confused, and then he 
realized it was 
merely a dream
an elusive dream 
he could not grasp. Gently, he 
touched his finger to his cheek,
 and his frown darkened.  
Snow!
 The word kept echoing within his head. 
Snow!
  
What is snow? Why snow? 
Then something struck him,
 and he rushed out 
of bed. He went 
into the walk-in closet and raided his luggage. A moment later, he 
found what he was looking for.  
It was a poster
his poster he had made a couple of months ago. 
And why he had brought it along with him to St. Joseph Island 

was beyond him. 
He unfolded the large paper and laid it out on his bed. There 
it was,
 a digital artwork 
of a dark knight and a maiden. She was a

She was Snow White.  

understand 
the connection between the dream 
hed just had and this artwork 
hed created a few months ago
. Perhaps it really meant nothing at all, and he decided to brush it 
aside. Perhaps it was just seeing the cherry trees here 
on St. Joseph 
Island that had triggered the dream. After all, there was that 
massive cherry tree in full bloom of pink flowers in the background 
of the poster. Yes, that was probably it. 
And the girl in his dream? 
She 
must be Snow White from the poster. Of course it had to be, 
and that made tota
l sense.  
But why did he feel so lost when he
d woken up to find Snow 
gone? Why did he feel as though he were missing half of his soul?  
He stood, picked up the poster,
 and hung it on the wall 
opposite his bed. He had just finished and was getting back int
o bed when he heard noises from outside along the corridor. It was

 dream, and she was determined not 
to think about it any further.  
She closed her eyes and tried to get back to sleep when she heard 
Tara and Alaina giggling across the hallway and singing loudly 

before finally getting into their own rooms. Sakura was pretty sure 

the two women must be pretty drunk since they both loved to 
drink. Once the house was quiet again, she was able to slip back to 
sleep. This time there was no dream,
 and she was glad. 
About two hours later, Sakura found herself lying there in her

response.

 The brothers shuffled uncomfortably in their seats as though all 
of a sudden memories came flooding back.  

 this beautiful girl was Sakura, their 
adopted sister from years ago. The girl who Tara and Alaina had 
always picked on and made fun of. She was the girl he had secretly 

liked to watch from afar because she interested him. There had

deep within him. Eventually, he

that was until yesterday and then today.  
Again he felt that odd pain 
throbbing within him, oddly hard 
to control. 
James reappeared with another big tray of scones, savory 
muffins, fried eggs, and toast. He placed it in the center of the table 

and sat down in the empty chair next to Sebastian.

d first sighted the 
island. It was because of her, Sakura, his adopted sister. He

for the past years. Not even a small thought of her had ever

that was why she and Mary were here helping out since only three

course the brothers

finally laid to rest. The glasses at the same time smashed into tin

it was the brothers.  
It was an hour later when Sakura reluctantly wished Lauren a 
happy 
birthday and told the girl 
she had to leave. Then she found 
herself sitting in the back seat by herself while Conrad sat in the 
front seat next to Mark,
 who was driving the car. Behind th
em, 
Sebastian drove the silver Mercedes with Nicolas and Logan as 

passengers, and Tristan drove the black one with Darcy and 

Hayden as passengers.  
Sakura was even more uncomfortable to be surrounded by eight 
very tall men in the small lift as they headed up to the fifth floor 

of the public hospital where the main lab was located. She held her 

breath until they got out, and by then her lungs were starving for 

oxygen and her whole body was aching because s
hed been so tense.  
Sherry, the lab assistant working under Mark, greeted them as 
they came in. She was quite shocked to see the Princeton brothers 

with Sakura. She blushed profusely when they smiled at her,
 and 
her hands shook uncontrollably when she handed them each

done, Sakura 

 The brothers got down to it, answering questions about their 
diet, medications (if they had any), daily routine, and exercise 

regime. Tristan and Logan, as usual, treated it like a competition 

and raced through the questionnaires. But it was Sebastian who 
finished first and headed out 
of the small reception area to 
the lab 
behind. Tristan muttered under his breath as he watched his 
brother go. Nicolas put his pen down and chuckled. 
Once he stepped into the laboratory area, Sebastian was taken 
aback by the scene before him. There were massive machines 

running tests everywhere, 
some as big and as long as the length of 
the whole room and connected together like trains. There was 

quite a number of staff on the floor,
 working, putting test tubes 
filled with blood through the analyzers. 
He spotted Sakura in a small office on the other side of the lab. 
He headed for her, and once there he saw she
d put on a lab coat 
and had her long hair tied back into a ponytail.  
He knocked on the door.  

She turned.  

He almost forgot how to breathe once his eyes met hers. She 
looked really sophisticated and professional in her 
lab coat. 
Not to 
mention as sexy as hell.
  
He swallowed. 
And then he remembered how to breathe 
properly.

 Sakura bit her lip and told her heart to stop beating so fast. It 

. Nothing more. But why was her heart beating so fast,
 and why 
were her hands shaking? 
She came round to look at his arm up close. Her fingers gently 
touched 
against the skin of his forearm, feeling for his vein.  
Sebastian suddenly stopped breathing for a second. When he 
breathed again, his heart was beating so fast he thought he 

going to make it. He could smell her wonderful scent
the very 
same one from when he
d first met her
and it made his head 
swim in delight. He could feel the heat of her body against his, and 

his whole being stirred 
in pleasure.  

 Sebastian could feel the warmth of her breath fanning over
 his 
skin, which 
sent pleasure rushing through his body.

reassure herself than him,
 of course.  
She stood up straight and prepared the tubes and needle. She 
wiped his skin clean with an alcohol swipe and then put a 

tourniquet around his arm. She told him to fist his hand to pump 

out the vein. He did as he was told, all the time watching her 

closely. 
84     Alexia Praks
  Sakura felt quite nervous by the fact that he was always looking 

why, but she had the feeling 
hed done 
that before when they were children. There was something in the 
way he was staring at her that made her nervous. Something that 

stirred her on the inside, making her restless. 

, and 
then she slowly inserted the sharp needle through his skin and into 
to his vein.  

 the 
needle going into his skin at 
all as he sat there watching her.  
Sakura hoped he was only staring at her 

to see the needle,
 like most people do,
 and so he concentrated his 
attention on something else. But it would have been nice if it was 
the painting on the wall or the rubbish bin to the side or,
 even 
better yet, the computer screen in the corner of the room

She quickly and steadily inserted a tube.

enhanced her eyes. Then he moved his eyes down to her lips
plump, luscious lips ready to be kissed and sucked.  
Sebastian unconsciously closed his eyes, feeling his blood 
stirring knowingly
almost painfully. His fingers itched to touch, 
to feel those soft ruby lips. When he opened his eyes again, he 

found himself staring at her chest. Since she was leaning toward 

him, and the fact that she was wearing that stupid doll-
like 
strapless dress that barely cover
ed her upper portion, he had a very 
good view of her lovely,
 round breasts thrusting out toward him, 
almost begging him to fondle, to kiss, and to
 
take this anymore,
 he thought and scowled darkly, his 
whole body fully alert with desire. 

 Sakura glanced up at him and their eyes met. He stared at her 
for a moment, lost 
in the depth 
of the 
brown.

 Sebastian saw the look on her face he

her again. It nearly broke his heart, and he had the sudden urge to 

pull her into his arms. Just as quickly, he realized that was a stupid 
thing to want to do,
 and so he abruptly got up, leaving the room 
in haste,
 which confused the hell out of Sakura.

This Darcy was disgusted with her. And she had to keep that in 

mind and stay as far away from him as possible. Thus she turned 

her attention to bleeding him 
instead.  
She made quick work of it and was indeed very glad it was 
finally over. Hence when Mark was busy giving the brothers a tour 

around the lab and going to extreme lengths to explain why his 

research was so importa

worked, Sakura hid in the bathroom, freshened up, and tried her

 Conrad stopped his questioning then, and Sakura sighed with

toward her with his wee, short legs.

 Tristan, Hayden, and Darcy happened to walk through the 
doorway at that moment. Tristan was laughing about something, 

and Hayden was giving Tristan a friendly punch on the arm. Darcy 

just shook his head at his brothers. Of course,
 theyd been talking 
about women again and the best method to get them in the mood 

for 
sex.  
They all came to a complete stop at the corridor when they 
noticed their brothers were still standing there awkwardly. Darcy 

wondered why and knew instantly once he had spotted Tara before 

them, standing there as if she were posing for a photo shoot for 

some hot magazine.

who she was. Then her eyes seemed to blaze with blue fire, and her 

hands fisted tightly at her sides.

had done.  

 Sakura opened her eyes and looked up to see a pair of blue eyes

 A few minutes later, they arrived in town.
 It was a picture-
perfect little town with beautiful old buildings dating back to the 

eighteenth century. Most of the shops and eateries were set up by 
the waterfront. Hence they had an excellent view of the beach and 
the blue ocean beyond. In the far distance,
 one could almost see

 Sakura smiled up at him, her eyes twinkling. She wondered if 
he wanted to be friends with her and perhaps get to know her a bit 

better as adopted siblings. Or perhaps she wondered if he was

grown adult. No one had time for that sort of bull now, and to be 
frankly honest, neither did she.

 By that time, all the brothers had caught up with them. Sakura 
turned around to have a look. Her heart skipped a beat as she gazed 
at the brothers, and it did a triple skip once her eyes met

 The brothers got up as well and made their way 
to where the

face, which he also loved.  
They came to a small cafÃ© a couple of blocks farther

facing the beach and had a very good view of the ocean. It was also

 She glanced behind her at the seven

 At this the brothers laughed again,

something under his breath. Just then a pretty brown-

couple of blocks away. She had to catch her breath and wriggled 

release his hold on her, however, though he did stop to let her 

catch her breath.  
Sakura collapsed against the brick wall of a building. Hayden 
watched her, amused. He came to stand in front of her, blocking 

out the afternoon sun that was glaring down on her face. When 

she opened her eyes again, she gasped and caught her breath at the 

back
 of her throat. Hayden was standing so close to her that she 
could 
feel his warm breath fanning 
her face.  

.He chuckled, grinning at her. 
Sakura was still heaving. When she finally stopped, she gazed 
up at him, confused and dazed. 
What i

 Why had he 
taken her away from everyone else all of a sudden? 
Hayden moved his face closer to her
s, as if he was about to kiss 
her. Instead, however, he chuckled softly and gently blew air in her 

face to get her attention. She blinked.  

 Sakura blinked again and cocked her head to one side. Hayden? 
Asking her to go sightseeing?
 She wanted to laugh. Of all things,
 he wanted to take her sightseeing?
 Yes, she remembered him asking her
 144     Alexia Praks
  No, not ask. Hayden had never asked. Hayden had basically 
dragged her with him, as he
d just done moments before.  
Yes, from her very early experiences, sightseeing with Hayden 
usually meant sneaking out of the Princeton Estate and doing 
something dangerous and illegal, such as stealing a motorcycle,
 for 
example.  
She still remembered those days so clearly. He
d dragged her 
out with him late in the evening into town and then had stolen a 

Harley-

d had his eyes on for ages. 
After the thieving, he

 girl. Of 
course, this had gone on a couple of times until he

of the motorcycles. Naturally, Tara and Alaina had found out and 

had sneakily told Daddy James what happened. Hayden had been 
grounded for months, which pissed him off so badly that he turned 



  
Sakura turned her attention to the earring on his left ear then. 
She remembered him pressuring her to pierce his ear for him after 

that particular incident. He told her that since he
d been named 
the black sheep of the house, he might as well go all out and pierce 

his ear too to get that perfect bad-
boy image. She even had to pick 
him an earring and paid for it with her own money since he said it 

had been her fault from the start. When she
d given him the pair 
of silver earrings, h
e threw one back at her, telling her he only 
needed one. To this day, she still had that earring kept safely in her 

secret box. 

 Sakura jolted back to reality. She raised her brows at him. Since 
when had Hayden ever asked her for her decision? She leaned back

 Sakura turned to look at him. She knew nothing about 
motorbikes, and she was certainly not a motorbike fan, so what 

did he expect her to say?  
A moment later, after he realized 

any more out

 Yes, they were going to ride his motorbike home, and hopefully

 Hayden was now an expert 
motorcyclist, so the chance of them crashing was next to zero. Yet

their close contact.

why he

and the wind fluttering against her face,
 that she hastily stepped 
on the brake before she had the chance to crash into what was 

clearly a holdup in the middle of the road.  
Sakura pulled off her 

the sight she beheld before her. The brothers looked like they were 

posing for a Calvin Klein photo shoot
in the middle of the road 
and in the middle of nowhere.  
Conrad was standing on the roof of the SUV as if he
d just 
conquered Mount Everest. Tristan was half-
reclining on the hood 
of the car. Darcy was posing very nicely to the side near the front 

of the car. Sebastian was resting his weight against the car, his 

hands in the pockets of his jeans. 
 The moment she stopped, they made a move. Sebastian was 
scowling again. She wondered if he would ever stop scowling at 

her. Tristan slid off his rather comfortable recliner, and Conrad 

jumped down from the roof of the car.

 He was smiling

smiled. He was so charming, especially with his pale blond hair 
that was a bit too long and his azure-

Darcy watched from the window as the motorcycle and its 
riders came to a stop at the front of the house. He fisted his hands 

as he watched Sakura taking off her helmet. She was about to walk 

to the house when Sebastian caught her wrist and pulled her back 

to him. He was still holding on to her hand as he spoke to her, 

which really bothered Darcy. What was even worse was the fact 

that Sebastian was smiling as he was talking. From Sebasti

stance, the way his brother turned his torso toward Sakura, Darcy 

knew Sebastian was interested in Sakura personally. What really 
bothered Darcy was the fact that Sakura was responding, even if

Calm down, you old beast. Please calm down.  
From where she sat, Tara had a good view of the two people 
outside and really wanted to scream until the house tumbled down. 
Sebastian and Sakura? No. No. No. How?
 Oh, God help her. She 
was going to go crazy in a second.  
Finally Sakura walked away, and a moment later she was in the 
house along with Conrad.

fall down the stairs, and break her slender neck.

down the harder she fought, shoving her back into its depths.
 
and ready for action. 
Alaina and Tara looked up in dismay to see Darcy at the top of 
the diving board. They watched, dread and fear contorted on their 

beautiful faces, as Darcy, in jeans and T-
shirt, ran off the board 
and expertly and smoothly somersaulted down, flying in midair. 
His athletic body hit the water cleanly, and as he gained 
momentum within the deep pool, he swam toward Sakura,
 who 
was sinking 
toward the bottom. 
Darcy reached out to her, fearful he might lose her. He kicked 
so hard and fast that the water turned into a whirlpool. He caught 
her by the small of her waist and pulled her up to him, hugging 
her against him tightly. With her safely in his embrace, he swam 

back
 to the surface.  
Sakura sucked in air as they emerged from the pool. She 
coughed and spluttered water as she instinctively wrapped her 



dear life.  
Darcy, too, tightened his hold on her and started swimming 
toward the edge of the pool. Once there, he lifted her along as he 

pulled himself out of the water.  
He gently laid her on the marble floor, her back and head 
resting against his massive chest and his arm wrapping around her 

protectively. His heart was pounding with dread as he examined 
her face.  
God! Please let her be all right. Please!  
He felt his body shaking with emotions, with trepidation, as he 
gently touched his hand to her pale, cold skin.

Sakura pulled the dress back up to cover herself, barely. As in 
the nature of any woman, she only covered her breasts,
 so her back 
was still totally exposed 
to him.

naked women. It was just kind

He took a step back, trying to control himself, trying to calm

him.  

 178     Alexia Praks
  Sebastian heard him coming toward the bathroom, and before 
his brother had the chance to peek inside, he grabbed the dress 

 shut 
again.  
Sakura relaxed, thinking Sebastian had left. She gathered her 
long hair, bunched it up, and let it rest over one shoulder. Then 

she proceeded to turn to the running shower.  
Sebastian was hoping his desire would die down, but it was 
getting worse. His hand tightened on the dress. 
Shit,
 he thought. 
He had to get out of here.  

 Sakura was testing the water with her fingers and reluctantly 
turned to answer Conrad. She gasped in fright when she saw 

Sebastian was still in the bathroom with her.

 He passed her the dress and after turning the doorknob left the

threw her the towel.

Conrad,
 who was now sitting on the carpet with Toby on his lap.  
Sebastian came to sit beside him, his back resting against the 
bed. He turned h

instantly surprised at what he saw. He thought her bedroom would 
be plain with just a normal-
sized double bed, a wardrobe for her 
clothes, and perhaps a study desk. But this was far from it. Her 
room was designed and decorated tastefully, with a soft, earthy 
palette. There was a featured wall where the head of the queen-
size 
bed rested
lovely pink cherry blossoms and golden leaves. There 
was a French-
Georgian style recliner, sofa, and study desk and 
chair. He noted the laptop, camera, and sketchbook and pencils 
A Secret Kiss

What a beautiful combination.

 Sebastian nodded to the bathroom. 


 
 Darcy came to sit on the other side of Conrad, folding his arms 
across his chest. The three waited in silence, dreading to find out 

if their victim would be all right after the attempted murder. A few 
minutes later, Sakura opened the door, and they all hastily stood.  
Sakura was so shocked to see three men in her bedroom waiting 

forgetting why she was in such a rush to get out of the bathroom 

with her wet hair in a wild mess and her skin not yet dried properly.

dress on, her skin still wet and her hair still wild, looking at the 

three uninvited men in her room. 
Sebastian had a good, thorough look at his very pretty adopted 
sister. That white dress was rather fetching on her, showing off her 

very slender figure. The top bit, however, was designed in such a 

way as to hug the breasts. The neckline was rather low and showing 
porcelain-
white skin that begged for a caress. Not to mention there 
were buttons in the front starting from about her diaphragm to the 
top. 
Gosh!
 Did she not think to button up properly?

Once she closed the door, Conrad happily made himself 
comfortable on the bed, Toby with him. Darcy sat on the chair by 

the study desk while Sebastian went through her wardrobe, 

searching for her bra and panties. Once he found some in a small 

drawer, he lightly knocked on the door. 
Sakura poked her head out and quickly grabbed the underwear, 
her face flaming red from embarrassment. Then she hastily closed 

the door again.  
Sebastian noticed the blushing but kept his face straight as he

When the maids brought in dinner, everyone ate and chatted, 
enjoying themselves. James, however, noticed that Sakura was 
rather quiet. He also noticed that Alaina and Tara were behaving 
oddly. They kept staring at Sakura as though they would like to 

hurt her. Protectiveness surged in his blood. He knew without a

something like this would 
happen when they arrived. He had also

pretty loud, probably talking animatedly to Conrad. Then there 

was the noise of Katherine, Mary, Peter, and Richard laughing and

in the laughter, as if nothing had happened earlier at the pool. It

trouble he did get her into because he had crashed the bike and 

had gotten grounded. What really pissed Sebastian off even more 

was the fact that Hayden had believed Tara and Alaina
 lies that 
it had been Sakura who had told on him. Now Hayden really hated 

Sakura.  
Then there were Tristan and Logan. His stupid teenage 
brothers had a bet on who would get to kiss Sakura first. He 

suspected 

ses yet from those silly, eager 
teenage girls from New York who would only be too pleased to let 

the boys take their virginities. Sebastian knew Tristan did get to 

kiss Sakura, albeit only on the cheek and in which case she had 

slapped him really hard afterward. Tara had seen, of course, got 

really jealous, and told James,
 who grounded both Tristan and 
Logan for a month. This
 only led to the boys despising Sakura 
even more, believing Sakura was the real bitchy adopted sister Tara 

and Alaina had constantly told them about. Though to be honest, 
Sebastian was glad 
his 
brothers now left 
Sakura alone.  
He watched her closing the book then running her fingers 
through her long hair. She got up and slowly made her way across 
the sandy beach to the rocky cliff by the sea. There she stood, 

gazing across at the 
ocean beyond. 
Sebastian watched her, his heart aching for her
for her 
loneliness and for her sadness.

threw himself into the ocean. 
Once his body 
hit the water, he pulled himself together and swam.  
Within the deep, murky water, he tried his best to find his way 
to help Sakura. But she was nowhere in sight,
 and he panicked. 
No! 
He had to find her. She had to be somewhere 
here.
  
He found her being dragged down to the bottom. He reached

 He needed to breathe. But there 
was Sakura. He had to save her.  
He closed his eyes,

then he was out

breathing was labored,
 and his heart was thumping hard within his

dream.
 

 The incident
he had forgotten about that incident 
until now. 
But did he really forget about it, or was it that the incident was too

That was when he heard the scream from next door. It was loud 
and full of fear. Sebastian dashed off his bed and out the door in 

two seconds flat. He met Darcy, who was half-naked,

 Sebastian placed her on her bed and pulled the blanket up to 
her neck. Soon she was in deep sleep. The two brothers stood there, 

watching the woman who had affected them so much, both 

mentally and emotionally, in these past few days. She had brought 

back their memories of their childhood, of the pain and of the 

pleasure of being with her. Now more than ever, they both realized 

they no longer wanted to forget about her, no longer wanted their 
memories of her to lie dormant in their minds. No, what they 

wanted now more than ever was to embrace her, to welcome her

When he finally stopped, she groaned and her lips searched for

wish by kissing her again. 
This time, she responded by tightening 
her arms around him and whispering

She seemed to relax at his reply and snuggled deep against his 
chest as she fell into a deep slumber. Soon, Darcy too fell asleep
, hugging her against him, never wanting to let her go. 
 When he woke again, it was morning, and he noted that her 
body was hotter than ever and her breathing was even more 
labor
ed, as if this was her final hour. He panicked, rushed out of 
bed, and ran to get his parents. 
Oh,
 God, 
he thought, 
please let her be all right.
 Please!
 Alone, Sakura groaned softly. Her chest hurt. She felt so very 
hot and so very weak. She 
opened her eyes, and the first thing she 
thought was that she had to get out of here. No one wanted her 
here, so it would be best if she left. Yes, that would be best. 
Without thinking, she sat up, and instantly the world spun 
around her. She touched her forehead, trying to get her bearings
. Once the world had decided to stop spinning, she put her feet to 
the floor and got out of bed.  
A Secret Kiss     
203  Slowly and dazedly, she wandered out the door, down the stairs, 
and then out of the mansion into the hot summer outside. 
Birds were chirping,
 and the winds whispered past her. In the 
distance, she saw the endless green land and blue sky. Yes, she 

needed to go. She needed to get out of here.  

, nor did she care just as 
long as she was out of this place where no one wanted her. She had 
thought at first that they wanted her,
 that they loved her, but now 
she knew better. None of them wanted her. They all hated her. 
Even Darce. 
 It was so very hot, and she was so very thirsty. Her chest hurt. 
Why did it feel like she had a ton of bricks 
on top of her chest?  
She coughed and the pain intensified. It was truly unbearable. 
She groaned 
in agony. 
Why is it so bright out here?
 She blinked and stared up the endless 
sky. Suddenly, the world spun before her again. She sighed, feeling 

awfully helpless. 
At least 
going to see my real mother now, 
she 
thought and collapsed there amongst the overgrown grass in the 

middle of nowhere. 
It was so very dark now, and she knew then that she was going 
away. Oddly enough, she was glad to leave this place where no one 

wanted her, where no one loved her. That was when she saw the 

light. It was beautiful and it beckoned to her, enticing her to come 
toward it.

 When she did manage to open her eyes sometime later, she saw

she was too weak to do so. Then she felt herself being moved and 

her body was on top of someone. The chest was bare and very 

warm. She sighed and rested her face against the nape of the

Sebastian touched her chin and nudged her face so she could 
look at him. Very slowly he brought his face down to hers, and 
gently he kissed her on her lips.  
Her lips were soft, and Sebastian loved the feel of her against 
him. His kiss was gentle and soft and very, very loving.  

So he loves

 she 
thought. She was so very happy. She relaxed against him and 

allowed him to kiss her deeper.  
Sebastian had never kissed any girl befo

very first. Though he was inexperienced, his innate nature knew 

what it was doing. He opened his lips, plunged his tongue into her 
small mouth, and kissed her deeply

When Sakura opened her eyes,
 it was so bright she had to 
shut them again. This time, she slowly fluttered her eyelids open 

to get used to the sharp brightness. As she stared up at the ceiling, 

she wondered why she was sleeping in so late and why she was 

feeling so tired.  
Slowly she brought her fingers to touch her lips, gently 
caressing them

 She continued to stroke her lips as her brain searched far and 
wide for that elusive dream she was sure she had last night. Then 

in a flash, what happened yesterday rushed back to her. Suddenly 

she felt that heavy burden within her chest.

year-
old woman, and 
Tara and Alaina had still managed to bully her. This was 


 She gritted her teeth. 
No!
 From this moment forward, she 
would no longer allow those two vile women to hurt her. 
Nope! 
Not anymore.
  
208     Alexia Praks
  At that thought, she fisted her hands and jumped off the bed, 
suddenly no longer tired. Yes, she knew exactly what to do. She 
would never drown again
ever!
 Without taking a good look at herself, she rushed out the door 
and headed straight downstairs. With a determined look on her 

face, she burst through the dining room door. 
The brothers, who were at that moment sitting around the table 
having their very late lunch since th
eyd just returned from their 
very unpleasant hairdressing experience, looked up. What they saw 

nearly sent 
them to heaven.  
Sakura was in her pajamas of cotton sleep shirt and shorts. The 
buttons of the shirt were mostly undone from the top to midway 

down her chest,
 thus showing off her lovely flesh beneath. Since 
her shirt was quite long,
 the hem reaching down to just above her 
thighs,
 
shorts, thus 
showing off her lovely bare, long, slender legs. Not to mention her 

hair was a mess, her skin petal white, her lips red, her cheeks tinged 

a rosy color
, and her eyes were wild and large as she gazed at them.  
She was hot. She was sexy. And every one of the brothers 
wanted to ravish her. 
Nicolas choked on his coffee,
 and his glasses nearly fell off his 
fine nose as he stared at the young woman at the door. Tristan 

blinked and blinked and blinked yet again. Logan forgot he was 
pouring himself a cup of coffee and k
ept on pouring until the 
coffee was pouring onto the white linen tablecloth. Sebastian had 
a piece of sandwich in his mouth and it stayed there. Hayden had 

a piece of sausage on his fork,
 ready for his mouth, but now the 
sausage had escaped back onto the plate and the fork was in his 

mouth by itself. Darcy could only stare at her in shocked surprise. 

And Conrad grinned, his eyes large, his face flushed red at seeing 

her in such a seductive 
state. 
Sebastian was the first to gain his wits, and after he
d finished 
chewing his sandwich and awkwardly swallowed, he cleared his 

throat and told his brothers to quit staring.

 Logan blinked, turned his attention to his coffee, and when he

laughed at his brother. 
Sakura closed the door behind her and announced to the room, 

 Sebastian snapped up his head and stared at her in amazement. 
Darcy widened his eyes, and Conrad smiled even wider. Tristan 

got up and came around to her. He had a grin on his face that 
made his brothers suspicious. Without warning, he grabbed 

Sakura, pulled her into his arms, and hugged her real tight.

long hair was completely gone and now the length only reached

model in a fashion magazine. His eyes met hers, and she caught 
her breath at the back of her throat.

brothers, they had their hair professionally trimmed and styled.

Tristan said, pulling her out of her chair.  
Sakura reluctantly followed them out of the dining room door, 
and only moments later she found herself in the pool area with 

seven grown men.  
She shrieked and nearly ran from the scene when she saw 
Sebastian pulling off his T-
shirt. Her heart thumped so loudly in 
her chest and her stomach flipped so hard she thought she was 

going to die of a heart attack.  
Oh m
y gosh!
 Sebastian looked amazing with just his jeans on. 
His muscles were toned and well shaped,
 not to mention his six-
pack. Sakura had heard of women who liked to look at men, 
especially at their abs, and sigh with that odd feeling in the pit of 
their stomachs. She thought that type of thing would never ever 
happen to her, but she was wrong. She was feeling it right now. 
Her body felt all tingly,
 and her breathing became a bit labored.  
She saw Sebastian looking at her in that strange way of his again. 
She bit her lip and hastily looked away, only to see Darcy taking 

off his shirt, too.

Sakura bit her lip and blinked, her whole being quivering

 Darcy got up, and with his jeans still on, jumped into the water. 
Suddenly it was like a real race as the brothers all climbed back out 

and took their positions.

Sakura felt her heart start to thump faster and faster. Her body 
tensed and stiffened 
as she waited patiently.  

 God,
 Sakura thought,

their tall, lean bodies all bending like so, ready to throw themselves

God, how was he going to deal with this forbidden blaze of desire

she too was beginning to feel the same way toward him.

Sakura gasped involuntarily the moment he stopped in front of

Sakura turned her attention to Darcy,
 who was just getting 
himself out of the pool. She noted that his toned, muscular body 

was wet, beads of water kissing his tanned, smooth skin. As he 

stood up, he stroked back his dark hair, and incidentally, his eyes 
met hers. Her breath caught at the back of her throat as he gazed 
at her. Her heart began to race and her fingers

before she met the brothers. She picked this particular picture 

because the tree stood alone with petals floating across in the wind,

  and in the distance, there were hills and beyond that the sea of the 
island. It was perfect for her painting.  
Ned put down his brush and folded his arms across his chest, 

 Sakura flicked her eyes to him, taking in his silvery-
gray hair, 
thin face, and slight frame. He was completely different from Beth 

considering the fact that they were siblings. Their personalities, too, 
were completely different. Beth was the outgoing one with a no-
nonsense attitude while Ned was the laidback one, very quiet and

to stay in the background.  
Sakura had met him when she first moved into Princeton 
Mansion, and since then,
 he had become a very good friend of hers
, treating her like his very own daughter and teaching her how to 

draw and paint. He had said that first day in the garden that 

painting was like meditation.
 It calms you down and makes you 
forget about the world. He had been right. When Sakura painted, 

she forgot about the world, so consumed she was with her work. 

Then when it was finished, it was like seeing her baby coming to 

life for the first time. She felt proud. That was why she loved to 

paint now.

Sebastian helped by picking up the pieces of papers that were 
on the floor. Sakura saw he was about to read her very confidential 

report and snapped it from his hand, none too gently. She quickly 
folded it carefully and shoved it in her bag, her hands shaking. 
Sebastian noticed her odd reaction and was instantly suspicious 

but said nothing.  
Sakura put her bag farther away from them and returned to her 
coffee.

back at the pool. Suddenly, her heart fluttered within her chest. 
Darcy!
 Should she go and return those to him now? 
She picked up the pair of socks and poked her head out the

The large king-

who sat in that very comfy chair there decided to lift his head, he 

would see the lovely view of the pond outside. Sakura cocked her 

head to one side, wondering if he

wondered if he did digital art. Then she swore at herself. Of course 
he did.

 Then something caught her attention. It was a gigantic digital 
art poster on one side of the wall. She caught her breath, truly 
amazed at the artwork. To say it was fantastic was an 

understatement. It took her breath away the moment she set her 

eyes on it. 
It was set in a fantasy world with a gothic castle and a cherry 
tree in full bloom in the background. However, what really 

fascinated her and what really caught her breath in the back of her 

throat was the central picture of the dark knight and a fair maiden. 

The pair caused her insides to shiver with something akin to 

pleasure and delight.  
The knight was in gothic fantasy, medieval war clothing, had 
long, sinful black hair,
 which was tied back, and had one hand 
holding a dangerous-
looking long, kickass sword that gave her the 

way. The other of his long, masculine hands was embracing the 
beyond-
beautiful maiden. Sakura could only stare, wondering if 
any woman in existence could compare to this exquisite beauty in 

the poster. She had long black hair, her skin petal white, and her

red color. She wore a fantasy-

beauty even more.

in a different world as she continued to stare at the poster.  
Suddenly, the door opened and Sakura gasped in fright, 
twisting herself around to witness Darcy coming in. 
Oh,
 God!
 Darcy could only stare in shocked surprise to see his adopted 
sister in his bedroom.
 His heart began to thump so loud in his 
che
st, like an African drum beating under the moonlight. He gazed 
at her, taking in the wild hair, the soft skin, the bare legs, and the 

bright eyes. 
Holy shit! She is hot.
 There were butterflies within the 
pit of his stomach and his body was trembling with longing.  
They continued to stare at each other in silence, totally

 Suddenly the doorknob

Sakura gasped when she found him in the closet with her. Then 
she watched him hastily close the door behind him. She tried to 

breathe normally, but it was so difficult with him literally

Sakura had taken the chance and eagerly snuggled her face 
against his chest. At that moment, his presence, his warmth, and 
his smell had eased her fear of her nightmare and eventually she 
had fallen asleep, feeling safe and loved in his arms. 
 Now Sakura felt exactly like that. His presence, his warmth 
against her, and his smell
they all brought back that wonderful, 
warm feeling she always had when he was near her. At that 

realization, her heart began to beat faster and faster, 
and her pulse 
refused to
 calm down. Suddenly, she realized his lips were on her 
forehead, and in response, her insides quivered with pleasure, 
causing her head to spin with delight.  
Darce,
 she whispered internally. 
Please, Darce, come back to me.
  
This closeness was driving Darcy crazy. God, how much longer 
could he handle this? How much longer could he control himself 
from ravishing this woman before him? Suddenly, he felt her hands 

moving down his torso. 
Oh,
 God!
 Did she realize her movements 
were intoxicating him? That her light, feathery touches were like a 

caress, teasing him, letting him taste the forbidden pleasure he so 
wanted?

He tightened his fists in anguish as he inhaled the sweet scent

as I can get to you. 
He tried to calm this powerful passion he had for this woman 
by taking deep, shaky breaths, her long hair still in his hands, 

unseen by Sakura in the darkness.

had his tablet in front of him, was eyeing her from afar. Why were 
they watching her as if they were waiting for her to do something?

shape of her small waist and gorgeous breasts. With her hair

absolutely to die for.

Then she turned to her side to look at Sebastian to see if he was 
proud of her. When she met his gaze though, she saw something 

that caused her stomach to flip and her heart to skip. There was 
something in the expression on his face and that made her heart 
do a somersault. Then her stomach flipped again and her body 
ached,

 She forgot to float. 
She gasped and felt her body being pulled deep into the pool. 
She tried to scream, but the water muffled her voice. She reached 
out for help, and just before she hit the bottom, she saw Sebastian 

reaching his hand out to her, just like that time long ago back in 
the sea.  
He caught her hand and pulled her to him, his hand tight 
around the small of her waist. She hastily wrapped both arms

Sebastian made her part her lips, and she obeyed. He blew air 
into her mouth, straight into her lungs. She felt her body working 

again. Then she felt his tongue plunge into her, exploring her. 

Sakura felt like she was in heaven as millions of thrilling sensations 
exploded through her being. She tightened her arms around his 
neck, never wanting to let go.  
The two bodies floated there in the depths of the pool, swirling 
around, kissing deeply and passionately.  
Then, as
 if lightning struck him, Sebastian flashed his eyes open 
and drew back, terminating the kiss. He started to swim to the 

surface, taking her along with him.  
Sakura sucked in air once they got out of the water. Without 
looking at her, he guided her to the side of the pool and easily

Sebastian listened until he heard the door shut, then pulled

relationship, then what did that have 
to do with her?  
She got out of the shower, dried herself, and put on a pair of 
skinny jeans and a light blouse. After blow-
drying her hair and 
putting on some light makeup, she stared at herself in the mirror,

Yes,

thought.
 She looked just fine. Maybe just a bit red in the eyes, but 
that was all.  
Suddenly, she was thinking about Sebastian again. 
This is

 she thought as she stared at herself in the mirror. Why

. Sebastian and Tara? 
 She turned away from the mirror in disgust. God, she needed 
to calm down. She needed to be doing something. She needed to 
get her mind out of this stupid notion of Sebastian and Tara 

together.  
She left the bathroom, grabbed her camera and her bag, and 
headed out the door.  
Half an hour later, she was deep in the woods, alone with nature. 
She had already missed lunch, but that was okay because she

a big breakfast before
 She paused right there. 

 Her phone beeped. She took it out and saw she got a text 
message. It was Conrad, scolding her for going off without telling 

him. She also got text messages from Nicolas, Tristan, and Logan, 

informing her that 

 better turn up for dinner or else.  
Else what?
 And how did these guys get her number anyway? 
Mary? It must have been Mary. 
She put her phone back into her satchel and took out her 
camera. She tested the light, found that it was excellent, and then

living there. She took 
photos of a grasshopper hanging on to the tall grasses, of bees 

sucking nectar from flowers, of birds chirping 
in the trees, and of 
wildflowers that were surrounding her. At a certain point,
 she felt 
as though someone were following her, watching her in the 

distance. She scanned her surroundings but saw no sign of anyone 

and relaxed again. She knew she had nothing to worry about 
because this was the Princeton Estate and no one else had ever set 
foot in these woods. For years,
 she
d roamed this place by herself. 
It was in essence her playground, and she loved it that way. Hence, 

despite that odd feeling that someone was following her, watching 

her every move, she felt that she was, in actual fact, very safe.  
In fact, Sakura did not know that Sebastian was following her. 
He had spotted her heading out into the woods when she left the 

house and had desperately wanted to go to her and explain what

anything to do with him. Thus,
 he stayed back, following her 
silently like he always had when they were 
children.  
Still oblivious to Sebastian tailing her, Sakura came to the

tree on the island. It was her tree, the one she

massive height,
 and the flowers bloomed beautifully

had enough, she sat underneath it, her back resting against the big 

trunk. 
She sighed, inhaling the scent of spring air. Then she brought 
the camera up and started flicking through the photos, smiling 

with satisfaction as she inspected each one in turn.  
Alone, she set down the camera and gazed across the distance

everything.

in full force. 
Darcy stopped himself from going any further and moved back 
just in time when Sakura fluttered her eyes open. She gazed at him, 

their faces so close to each other that she could feel his warm breath 

on her skin. She blinked.

 Sebastian gritted his teeth and stared at her long and hard. 
Darcy, feeling protective over Sakura, clasped his hand over hers. 

Sebastian noticed and nearly exploded.  

 For the first half of the game, Sebastian and Darcy were at each 

s throats. They were neck to neck, intercepting and stealing 
the ball from one another and throwing it into the hoop. It was 

like they were at war playing basketball. It was like they were the 

only two people on court, 
and everyone else 
were just bystanders.  
Nicolas shook his head and knew those two had a score to settle,
 though he had no idea what the reason was. Then when he noticed 
both brothers constantly kept checking up on Sakura to see 
whether she was all right, he knew.  
When halftime was over, the teams were even. Sebastian refused 
to lose and told his team members to step up. Nicolas chuckled 

and wondered if it was really the game Sebastian wanted to win or 

Sakura.  
It was the second half of the game that

  Darcy felt his stomach flip. Suddenly, he wanted to pull her 
into his arms and kiss her again until they were both breathless. 
Sakura stood in the middle of the court, her hands on her hips.  

 Sebastian wanted to lift her over his shoulder and take her 
away

to kiss the hell out of her because at the moment she was taunting

going to take the ball from her. Not this time, though. She twisted 

and jumped. Sebastian wrapped his arms around her waist and got 

his legs twisted against her. The ball fell from her hands. Sebastian 

tightened his arms around her, and they both fell down, rolling 

together across the court.  
They came to stop on the other side, Sebastian on top of her.  

Sakura could feel his manly strength above her. She could feel 
his naked skin, warm and sweaty, against her palms. She fluttered 

her eyes open to see his face close to hers, his eyes watching her 

intently.

 A moment later, Hayden returned with the icepack. He handed

She turned away, her heart pounding in her chest.  
Sebastian moved back and watched her roll over so her back 
was to him. Reluctantly, he turned on his heel and headed out the 

door, switching off the light as he did so.  
When he came out,
 he saw Darcy in the corridor watching him,

 Sakura rushed to her room, trying very hard to hide her 
amusement. After browsing the Internet and doing a bit of 
research on apartments 
in New York, she did feel rather tired and 
went to lie down on her bed. She patted Toby as she closed her 

eyes, slowly falling asleep. 
When she woke up next, it was past midnight. The house was 
so quiet that she could hear her own heartbeat in her ears. No 

longer tired, she felt rather restless and wondered what she should

She was back at the edge of the pool now, her eyes closed as she 
was floating there, not thinking about anything at all. That was 

when she heard footsteps coming in. She flashed her eyes open and 

held her breath.  
The footsteps were quite heavy. Could it be one of the brothers? 
What? At this time of night? 
The footsteps were getting closer and closer. Then she heard 
the person climbing up the ladder. 
Darcy?
 She looked up at the 
figure at the top of the high diving platform but only saw 
a dark 
shadow. Then she heard the board squeaking and then she saw the 

figure of a man jumping off and then

like whoever it was knew she was here anyway.  
Nodding at that decision, she was about to turn but felt 
somebody in the water in front of her. Then an enormous body 

popped up, his massive chest pressing against her so she was 

imprisoned 
against the wall of the pool.  
Sakura gasped, and her 
heart thumped hard in her chest as she 
stared at the huge silhouette before her. The strong face was above 
her, water dripping, caressing 
it.

286     Alexia Praks
  The body stiffened. Sakura watched in awe at the muscular 
arms that came up and trapped her on both sides. She licked her 
lips.  

  Sakura felt her stomach flip. It was Sebastian.

toward the edge of the pool.  
Sebastian watched her go for only an instant, and then in a split 
second, he caught her by the waist and pulled her back to hi

his hand to hold the back of her head,

doing this to her. He loved her,
 so why was he hurting her? 
 When he opened his eyes again, he knew he had to win her over. 
So he kissed her again. This time, though, it was gentle and very 

passionate. Her lips were soft and warm against his, both his hands 

cupping her face. Slowly, his tongue played with her lip, teasing, 

caressing, stroking, and licking her along the length of those 

marvelous, sensuous lips. Then he made her open her mouth for 
him, and when she did, he plunged his tongue in, exploring her, 
tasting her, teasing her, and caressing her with all the experience 
he had.  
Sakura struggled to gain her mind back. She was lost, so very 
lost in this wonderful, delightful, heavenly kiss that Sebastian was 
288     Alexia Praks
  giving her. How could she feel this way? With only a kiss? But oh, 
it was such a kiss. She was breathless; she was mindless. Her body 
melted within his embrace. Her heart raced a million miles a 

minute. And something deep and hot burn
ed within her being. 
She softly groaned.  
She was totally lost as he deepened the kiss.
 His fingers dug 
deep into her wet hair while he had one hand down the small of 
her back, pressing her against him. 
Oh,
 God!
 She could feel him 
growing hard. And instead of anger or revolt, she felt herself 
growing warm and excited.

He stared at her, his face a mask. His eyes, however, spoke 
volumes 
because they were flashing blue fire.  
Sakura moved back, but before she got any farther, he pulled 
her back to him and kissed her again, this time deeper and wilder 

as he plunged his tongue into her mouth, stroking and lashing his 

tongue against hers. His hand was strong and firm behind her head, 

holding her still as he continued to kiss her. His other hand was

she continued to bite him. 
Instead, he looked pleased. There was pain in his eyes, but there 

was pleasure also, as thrilling sensations rushed through his being. 

Oh,
 God!
 She was beautiful biting him. 
Sakura bit his flesh as best she could and then moved back. 
Once she

paddled to the other side before he caught her again.  
Sebastian watched her go, climb up out of the pool, grab her 
clothing,
 and literally run from the room in her underwear. He felt 
his blood run hot with desire. She had been swimming in her 

underwear. 
Holy shit!
 It was such a turn-
on.  
Slowly, he turned his eyes to the bite mark on his chest and 
smiled. He touched it, gently caressing the mark with his fingers. 
A few moments later when he was sure she was gone, he got out 
of the pool and headed back out. Before he reached the door, the 

room flooded with bright lights. He turned to see Darcy at the 

door. He walked to his brother, wondering if he was here 

practicing his diving at this bloody hour. But then again, it was 

Darcy. He could very well practice his diving at three in the 

morning if he wanted to.

Toby could go out as he pleased. 
She came down to the kitchen and was glad no one was around. 
It was pretty late in the morning, after all. Lunch was only a few 
hours away. She made quick work having her breakfast of cereal 

with some fruit and milk. Just as she was about to finish, Mary

 Some twenty minutes later, they arrived at the Princeton Hotel 
and Resort. It was a very grand building of nine stories and had 

the beautiful private beach conserved specifically for guests and a 

great view of the ocean beyond. They parked the car in the reserved 

lot and headed into the main lobby via the grand entrance. A few 
A Secret Kiss     
293  minutes later, she came into the main hall on the first floor where 

the wedding reception was to be held. Sakura was surprised to find 

that both Richard and Peter were already there, talking to the 

wedding planner and the hotel manager. 

 
 Both Sakura and Mary looked around the great hall. It was 
beautiful
ly decorated with red and white roses.
 T
he tablecloths, a

, were of the finest quality, and the lighting was just 
perfect.  
For a couple of hours, the wedding planner explained to them 
what had been done,
 and then Peter and Mary told them what 
needed to be changed as Sakura stuck around, trying to help out 

with ideas as best as she could. When by lunchtime they finished, 

Sakura excused herself to go and find Daddy James.  
She came up to his office on the top floor of the hotel and gave 
the door her usual three knocks before going in. Once inside, to 

her surprise, she found Sebastian and Nicolas there, and Daddy 

James was nowhere in sight.  
Sakura bit her lip and her heart thundered within her chest the 
moment her eyes met Sebastian
. The handsome man raised one 
nice brow at her and gave her that sly grin of his that told her he 

was very pleased to see her indeed. She scowled at him to tell him

on the other hand, was oblivious to their silent bickering and gave 
her a smile.

 Nicolas pulled her by the arm and led her to the armchair near 
the window. Sebastian watched her intently. Their kiss last night 
was still fresh in his mind, and right now he felt the thrill rushing 
through his blood.  
Sakura caught him looking at her. He grinned at her, his blue 
eyes intense on her person, telling her he would like to do it again 
right now if he could. Sakura gritted her teeth and glared at him.

heart jolted within her chest. What about that kiss in the woods? 
Had that really meant nothing to him? She was totally confused 
by his actions. 
A few moments later, Mary, Peter, and Richard joined them.  

She sat down and had lunch beside Mary, who kept chatting 
animatedly to Peter. Conrad chose to sit on her other side, who 

also kept on a constant conversation,
 
to take in as she was too deep in her own thoughts. Then she felt 

someone watching her. She lifted her head and saw Darcy gazing 
at her from across the table, his face a hard mask, his mauve-
gray 
eyes intense on her face. Her pulse raced and her breathing became 
short. He looked as though he were in a dilemma, in pain. 
Darcy was in fact in a very deep, dark dilemma. 
What to do?
 Oh, God, just looking at her caused his insides to ache. How could he 

back out of wanting this woman to be his when he loved her so 

much? But then again, his brother Sebastian was also in love with 

this woman. How could he steal Sakura from Sebastian? They were 
family. But he loved this woman

 His heart hurt.  
Sebastian, sitting beside Nicolas and Conrad, noticed Darcy 
and Sakura staring at each other and gritted his teeth.

had just punched her in the face. It was Kate Anderson, her ex-
classmate, the popular cheerleader who had bullied her in high 

school. 
Mary nearly choked on her orange juice the moment she saw

Suddenly, Darcy was pissed. Why the hell did she have to turn 
up here and now of all places? After all, he had told her their 

relationship was over.  
He shoved his chair back, which caused Kate to jump back in 
surprise. He turned to look at her then, his face a mask of anger 

and his eyes dark. The look on his face scared Kate shitless, but she 

managed to compose herself because she was here for a reason. She

stalked out of the room. Kate felt

Sebastian turned his eyes to Sakura and noted her hands were 
shaking. His stomach knotted in dread. 
Shit!
 Sakura chose that moment to get up and excuse herself, her 
voice shaking. Then she rushed out and headed straight to her car.

Soon she came near the Princeton Estate, and instead of driving 
up to the house, she parked the car on the side of the road and ran, 

just ran into the woods until she reached her cherry tree, the very 

same tree where Darcy had kissed her.  
She collapsed against the tree and cried her heart out, her body 
shaking and her heart trembling. She stayed there, for how long

 listening to 
the 

 played by the St. Joseph Island Orchestra. 
She gazed at the scene before her in awe. She had been right. A 
wedding in spring was absolutely beautiful, especially when the 
ceremony was done under the cherry trees in full bloom. To the 
left was the pond, the clear water sparkling under the bright 

sunlight. Now and again, there were soft, gentle breezes which

rain 
down on them. It was so nostalgic. 
Then it was time, and Sakura found herself not quite being the

of attention, but 
still 
the center 
of attention nonetheless,
 as 
she slowly made her way down toward the platform where Peter 

stood waiting patiently for his bride. Richard and Jack, both in 

formal attire of black and white, stood to one side of Peter, their 
hands 
clasped back.  

 as she took a peek at young 
Michael, who was holding on to a cute satin cushion with two gold

James had predicted. That dress they help

fit her slender 
body perfectly, showing off her fine, delicate figure. Her long hair 

was formed into a classic bun on top of her head with a bunch of 

flowers on the left side near her ear. It was the first time the 

brothers had seen her with her hair like that,
 and 

help but marvel 
at just how sophisticated and refined she looked.  
Darcy loved her exposed, swanlike neck and wanted to brush 
his finger along the length of it. Oh,
 God, he ached to touch her, 
to smell her, to feel her in his arms. But he knew

They reached the platform,
 and Michael rushed up to Richard, 
sighing with relief that his job was nearly over. Katherine and 

Sakura came to stand on the other side of the men, waiting for the 

bride to reach them. Everyone
s eyes were on Mary now, who was 
making her way very slowly to the front with her father,
 Mr. Collins,
 giving her away. Finally, Mary came up and Peter took 
her hand in his. Mr.
 Collins returned to his seat in the front row 
next to his wife. 
The minister smiled pleasantly at the audience before him. 
Then he began.
 
Collins and Peter Johnston,
 I welcome you all to this marriage 
ceremony. We are here today to encourage, celebrate,
 and support 
the covenant these two people, Mary and Peter, are going to make 

and to share in the joy that Mary and Peter experience as they 
pledge their love and commitment to each other. We rejoice in the 
manner God has led them to each other and got them to the place 


 Sakura tried to concentrate on what the minister was saying but

and saw both Darcy and Sebastian watching her, their eyes intense 

and their faces expressionless. She bit her lower lip.

 Sakura turned her attention to the cherry tree above them and 
thought that after tomorrow all the flowers would almost be gone 

again for another year. Yes, spring was nearly over, and instantly 
she felt sad.

Darcy seemed to stand as far away from her as possible. She 

understood their 
body language completely and told herself to get 
over it. 
Sakura had her camera with her as well and proceeded to take

embarrassed. She glanced to Mary and Peter, who were dancing

his blue eyes intense on her face.  
Sakura felt her heart thundering within her chest as she 

her eyes away from the handsome blond who was staring at her as 
if she were the only person in the room. The music was making

as everyone faded into darkness. Yes, he was twisting her around

 and she was laughing and smiling up at him, her eyes bright 
with love

down and took her lips, kissing her passionately and wildly as they

heart cried out in anguish.  
Finally, she managed to move her gaze away from his by casting 
her eyes downward, tears brewing within them. 
Richard moved her around again. Then when she managed to 
control her emotions, she was again looking at Sebastian. She 

gazed at him, again feeling that dreadful pain within her heart. 

They continued to gaze at each other as the song continued, her 

heart racing within her chest, her head dizzy as she leaned more of 

her 
weight against Richard, feeling weak all of a sudden. 
Suddenly the music came to an end and Richard laughed. 

 Sakura slowly looked up, her face pale. 

 
she said quietly. She needed to decide on what to do, what should 

happen next. Yes, she had come to the realization that she had 

feelings for both Darcy and Sebastian. But how could a woman 

have feelings for two guys at the same time? 
How?
 How was that 
poss
ible? Especially when the two guys were her adopted brothers? 
 She needed to think. She needed to clear her head. She needed 
to decide.  
Suddenly, the song

room and everyone rushed

laughing

he got up and slowly made his way homeward, his pace slow.  
It was after midnight by the time he reached Princeton 
Mansion, and as he made his way up toward the house, he saw the 

person who was responsible for his 
tormented heart. 
 She was wearing her very lovely nightdress, like the one she
d worn that night he and his brothers had met her in the garden near 
the pond. She looked like

her with Tristan and Logan came up, the one with them both 

kissing her on the cheeks. Tristan and Logan. They were the best 

of brothers and the best of best friends. They were never far away 

from one another, and they had always helped one another.  
318     Alexia Praks
  She flicked through some more photos and found some 
pictures of her and the whole family together. She was a part of 
them. She was 
a Princeton. Yes, there she was, standing in between 
Tristan and Conrad. Then there were Daddy James and Mom 

Brenda, Nicolas, Logan, Hayden, and of course the two men who 

affected her most
both mentally and emotionally
Sebastian 
and Darcy

She put down the camera, her heart aching even more as she 
thought of them both. Were they really fighting because of her? 

What was she going to do? They were brothers. She was their 

adopted sister. Y

began to paint some cherry trees. Yes, spring was almost over and

 The air was warm and breezy as Sakura headed down toward 
the garden near the pond where Mary and Peter had their wedding 
ceremony only that afternoon. 

 She closed her eyes and breathed in the spring air, her face tilted 
up toward heaven, serene. She stayed there for how long she did 

not know as her mind wandered off into the far distance. Then 

when she realized it was getting rather late, she turned on her heel 

and started walking back toward the house.  
A Secret Kiss     
319  She was deep in thought and was just passing the section of the 
garden with thick bushes when someone grabbed her arm and 

pulled her into the darkness.  
Sakura gasped, her heart pounding hard and fast as she 
instinctively tried to free herself from the tight imprisonment. 

, her voice weak. 
 The person turned her around so her back was resting against 
the thickness of a tree trunk and her front was to him. His 

masculine, lean body completely enveloped her, embracing her so 

she had no way of escape. Sakura could feel his warm heat radiating 

out to her, and her heart started to thunder loudly within her chest 

and her head began to go a bit dizzy.  

not at all seeing his face 
in the 
darkness.  
He was tall, she realized, for her head barely reached up to his 
shoulders, and his body was firm against hers as he pressed her 

back against the tree, squishing her beneath him. 

 As if to calm her down, as if to tell her that he meant her no 
harm, he gently touched his hand to her face and moved his lips 



through her being.  
Sakura closed her eyes and her body unconsciously relaxed in 
his arms. Her breathing became labored 
as he continued to stroke 
her neck down toward her collarbone and then lower toward her 

breasts.  
Sakura bit her lip, her head spinning,
 and her legs suddenly 
turned into jelly. Then she could feel his warm lips against her 

throat. She could feel the heat of his mouth burning against her 

skin, sending her head reeling with wonder. Then before she knew 

it she could feel his tongue on her sensitive skin, stroking her, 
kissing her, sucking her.  
She gasped as the heat within her decided to rise deliciously. He 
suddenly stopped. Sakura widened her eyes, wondering why he
d stopped. It felt so good.  
320     Alexia Praks
  She gazed up at him.
 All she could see was the shadow of his 
strong, handsome face above her.  
Slowly, he moved his fingers and stroked her bottom lip, as he 
was marveling at the soft flesh. She heard him breathing harder, as 
if he had difficulty controlling himself.  

 
to her query, and before she could 
understand what was going on, his firm lips were on hers.  
Sakura was taken by surprise. She could feel the heat from him 
as he passionately kissed her, his fingers digging deep into her hair. 

She felt weak and light, like a feather floating in the air, flying 

high
er and higher.  
She groaned and held on to him for dear life. In response, he 
deepened the kiss by plunging his tongue into her mouth and 

wildly invading 
her. 

dy shuddered in ecstasy as his tongue stroked 
and played with her, exploring her, sending wild passion coursing 

through her being, exciting her to such powerful levels that she 


Yes, she was lost in the wonderful heaven.  
Suddenly, he pulled back, as if he suddenly realized 
hed made 
a mistake. Sakura gazed up at his dark form, her heart pounding. 


 Then just as quickly, he pulled her into his arms and hugged 
her tight,
 as though he never wanted to let her go.  
He kissed her again, his tongue wild against hers, as if he were 
desperate to have her, as if he were afraid of losing her. When he 

pulled back again, he was breathless and she was shaking from head 

to toe.  
He whispered softly near her ear.

Just like that.  
Sakura stayed there staring into the darkness, her finger 
touching her lips, her heart pounding, and her head spinning. 

When she managed to get back to her room and then into bed, it 

was very late,
 or rather early in the morning.

She was restless. Her heart was still pounding. Her mind was still

Some ten minutes later, Sakura found herself walking along St.

sand that stretched endlessly across the horizon. With her sandals 
in her hands, she strolled along, staring off at the pristine blue sea

was a storm coming.

When Sakura managed to gain control of her body again, she

found that her body was too weak and the pain was too unbearable. 
Suddenly Kate was on top of her, kneeing her to the ground.

The brothers discarded their surfboards, diving deep into the

them, steering them off course. Sebastian dove deep under and

 and then suddenly 
another wave came and smashed against Darcy, swirling his body 

about and throwing 
it off against a rock, scratching his skin and

As soon as it was here, the wave was gone again, and Sebastian

he had to leave because the nurse begged him to.  
When Sakura woke the next morning, she was surrounded with 
people. Daddy James and Mom Brenda were sitting on one side of 
the room. Nicolas was leaning against the window, Tristan and 

Logan at the end of her bed, Sebastian and Hayden on her left, 
and Conrad on her right.  
She licked her lips and tried to get up. Conrad was fast. He

 she thought. At least 
he was saved.  
She closed her eyes, thinking about him, thinking of their 
childhood together, of the fun they
d had under that sakura tree 
in the woods. She thought of her stroking his dark hair as he lay 
there on her lap and stared up at the bright blue sky. It had been a 
beautiful childhood even though it had only been for a very short, 

short while. That was until the world and everyone had turned 

against her. Now, however, she was resolved not to think about 

those horrid experiences. Now she wanted to put everything in the 

past. She wanted to move forward. She wanted to make her own 

path and forge her own future. And even though she knew

to resolve the conflict that

again be best friends, which was what Alaina had wanted since

  Sakura had entered their lives. Sakura would not break either

that eventually they would forget about her. Eventually this Sakura

them would find that perfect woman they

Sakura opened her eyes, got out of bed, and slowly made her

her. Finally she came to the ward on the other side of the floor and

after the accident, but she had to make sure, had to see for herself

She stood by the door, watching him, her heart aching for him,

were connected to his person. He was probably on morphine or 

something to keep the pain away. 
Darce! 
My Darce!  
Slowly, she walked toward him lying there motionless. She 
came to sit on the side of his bed, her hand gentle and warm on 
his face as she stroked and caressed him, pleading for him to wake 
up, for him to open his eyes. 
 Slowly she lowered her head toward his face and gently she 
kissed him on his cold lips. Tears rolled down her cheeks as she 

continued to kiss him, pleading for him to wake up, pouring out 

all of her love and passion for him. Her hand dug deep into his 

thick,
 black hair as her tongue stroked his motionless lips.  
Her heart quivered with frustration and with pain. She 
whimpered within her throat as she continued to kiss him with a 

wild, feverous passion.

 Darcy responded, his hand at the back of her head, drawing her

one another. Sakura cried as they kissed, her heart bursting with 

pleasure and pain, with happiness and sadness. T
his was their final 
kiss.
 In effect, this was a 
good-bye kiss. 
Finally she moved back. Her lips were bruised red from their 
passionate kisses. She watched Darcy smile, content,
 as he closed 
his eyes again, falling back to his unconscious state.  
She watched him for a couple more minutes, memorizing his

   Sayonara, My Beautiful Family 
The old Toyota Corolla came
 to a halt a good distance 
from Princeton Mansion. Sakura, in jeans and a light 
sweater
, got
 out of the car. Ned watched her as she
 walked up the pathway 
toward the house, his eyes dark with sorrow.
 Sakura entered the house via the back door and then took the 
back stairs up to the second floor. Once she was in her room, she 
took out her treasure box and took out the cards she had prepared 

a few days ago.  
Some moments later, she was standing outside once again, 
looking toward the house. There were lights in the drawing room, 

and from this distance, she could hear the family going about 

doing their things.  
At this very moment in the drawing room, James and Brenda 
were sitting by the lit fireplace while Tristan, Logan, and Hayden 

were working on a get-
well poster for Sakura and Darcy. Nicolas 
and Sebastian were on their laptop
s, working on their card for the 
pair as well. Conrad was busy writing his get-
well messages on the 
card that he had handmade for Sakura. He was rather pleased with 

the outcome and hoped Sakura would love it.

341  As they went about doing their projects, engrossed, no one 
noticed Toby getting up from his cozy spot by the fireplace and 

trotting quietly to the door and then out of the house. The dog 

instinctively came to his master,
 who was standing by the pond, 
waiting for him.  
Sakura picked Toby up in her arms and kissed his nose. She 
gazed at the house a bit longer, her heart aching. She knew
, however, that

mother, to live her life, to experience her life. 
She closed her eyes and 
tears rolled down her cheeks.  
Sayonara, my beautiful family. Mono no aware. You are like the 
sakura flower. Bloom vibrantly, just like this spring, so beautiful and 
full of life and color. You are here in my life for only a short time, 
enchanting me with your wonderful way of life and your everlasting 
kindness, and a brief moment later you are gone again, out of my life. 
I am sad, my beautiful family, to leave you behind. I am sad to never 
see you again, to feel your love, to hear you call me sweetheart. But I 
must go. Thus

 Slowly, Sakura walked down the road, leaving her beloved, 
beautiful family behind. A few moments later, the car drove away 
from Princeton Mansion, away from Princeton Estate, away fro

Hand in hand, James and 
Brenda walked up the stairs to 
their bedroom on the first floor. As they came into the room, they 
immediately saw the little card sitting on the large king
-size bed. 
 James knew immediately who it was from and nearly broke 
down. However, he managed to control himself and picked up the 

card.  
 I love you, Daddy James and Mom Brenda. I will always be your 
daughter Sakura,
 no matter who I am or 
where I am. 
 
Brenda came to read the card by her husband and gasped out 
in anguish, tears rolling down her cheeks. James took her into his 

arms as tears, too, rolled down his cheeks.

Then, as

 He continued to stroke his dry lips as his mind searched far and

someone had kissed him last night? The warm lips. The gentle 

touches.  
Oh, 
 Then he saw the card sitting on the bedside table. He reached 
out for it and noted it was very pretty. It was a watercolor painting 
of a cherry tree, the very same tree that he and Sakura had sat under 
and where he

despair as tears flowed down his cheeks from his eyes and the world

his voice shaking.

over 
the horizon. Sakura raised her face and breathed in the 
fresh air. When she opened her eyes again, she saw the 
Statue of 
Liberty and in the distance New York City.

her, 
a smile on his face.

to the city beyond. The dog barked 
happily, and she laughed. 
Yes, she was heading 
to her new home and her new future. At 
that moment, the sun rose just above her, shining down on her,
 which gave her an orange picturesque beauty that if anyone cared 
to look would have taken their breath 
away. 
Sakura felt at peace as her serene face gazed off into the distance.

 She really did take his breath away.  
She stood before him now like a queen with her very refined 
figure. Actually, he should be referring to her as

he thought this title suited her rather well. Especially when she was
